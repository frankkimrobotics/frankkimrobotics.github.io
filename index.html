      <p><strong>Differentiable packing simulation for 3D irrregular packing</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rapid growth of e-commerce sector in logistics domain requires advanced packing algorithm that considers irregular object shapes</li>
        <li>However, existing methods (heuristics, RL) focus on accelerated collision checking between objects based on discrete shape representation</li>
        <li>Fundamental challenges for e-commerce packing involves dynamic stability, object orientaiton in continuous space, and underexplored combinatorial search on object packing sequence</li>
        <li>We addressed this challenges to convert packing problem into contiuous optimization using neural SDF, differentiable process, and topological graph search</li>
        <li>We compared our methods with mixed-integer programming, heuristic methods, and RL-based policy and achieved the state-of-the-art</li>
        <li>This work is collaboration with IMA, Italian logistics company</li>

      <p><strong>Uncertainty aware next-best-view planning for cluttered scene reconstruction with manipulability</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Active reconstruction is necessary for embodied AI in real world environment with unseen and cluttered objects.</li>
        <li>However, manipulation often fails due to the uncertainty in object shapes coming from high occlusion, sensor noise, and symmetry in object 6D pose </li>
        <li>We address this problem by reconstructing object 3D shapes in neural SDF with shape uncertainty </li>
        <li>For efficient planning, we've generated next-best-view planner for active reconstruction with robot manipulator considering industrial applications</li>

      <p><strong>Ice hockey player trajectory reconstruction from monocular video with GAN</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Estimating player 3D trajectory is crucial for advanced sports analytics in career development, team strategy design, and injury analysis</li>
        <li>However, sensor installation and attachment to athelets affects their performance and inefficient for scalable data collection</li>
        <li>To address this limitation of data for machine learning, we've developed GAN-based image-to-image translation network for converting icerink to dense field of colorized points for camera estimation</li>
        <li>For collected data of 1000 image samples of image frames and manually annotated camera pose, our method achieves 95% accuracy in terms of mIOU for partial and 92% of mIOU for whole ice rink</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Autonomous medical crash cart is crucial for alleviating the burdens of medical nurses in hospital environment which is labor intensive, stressful, and emergencies</li>
        <li>We converted a medical crash cart to autonomous by adding SW(YOLO,PID,ROS) and HW(Raspi, Intel Realsense D435, and ODROID with segway wheels) </li>
        <li>We first desgined interaction diagram considering the basic functionalities of the crash cart following the nurse in indoor scenes </li>
        <li>Our vision-based PID enabled to follow the target person within 1.4 meters and alleviating the burdens of carrying the heavy cart</li>

      <p><strong>Text-based human motion generation for human robot interaction environment</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Training robot policy for human robot interaction is challenging due to inefficient data collection process</li>
        <li>To overcome this issue, we tried to develop text-based motion generation network based on VAE and BERT using annotated human motion animation</li>
        <li>Given a scene of real world images, we generated the text-based motion to ensure collision-free motion of human body mesh for realistic environment</li>

      <p><strong>Robust human activity recognition from cross validation for ATM machine robbery</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>ATM machines are subject to the target of robbery even with alert systems that acts as a post-hoc scenario after the machine has damaged and being robbed</li>
        <li>However, suspicious actions can be estimated from CCTV camera stream and human pose estimation</li>
        <li>For minimizing the inductive bias towards native feature of person in front of the ATM, we developed multiple metrics based on the pose and shape for detect suspicious actions </li>
        <li>Our method classifies and detect suspicious actions with X% accuracy</li>

      <p><strong>Training deep generative models with RL for Traveling Salesman Problem with unit circle neighborhoods</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Traveling Salesman Problem(TSP) is one of the most popular NP-hard problems which is hard to find the general solution within a polynomial time once problem size increases</li>
        <li>In robotic applications, complex task planning is not only NP-hard, but contains continuous variables that complicates the problem to NP-complete</li>
        <li>Therefore, we focused on the traveling salesman problem with unit circle neighborhood where points in TSP are now continuous regions of unit circles</li>
        <li>To solve this underexplored problem, we developed hybrid methods by training graph attention-based pointer network for TSP, and heuristic local optimization using virtual force method</li>
        <li>Our method outperforms current SOTA heuristic solvers and efficiently converge to the local minima once TSP path is determined.</li>

      <p><strong>Automated camera-based estimation of rehabilitation criteria following ACL reconstruction</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rehabilitation process is hard to be measured due multiple factors including personalized performance, subjective metrics, and expensive installation of sensors</li>
        <li>By using the stereo vision and human pose estimation algorithm, we reconstruct repetitive human motion during rehabilitation exercise that accurately predicts the acceleration of human hip joint motion</li>
        <li>To overcome the inaccuracy from stereo images with estimated human skeleton poses, we've applied prinicpal component analysis (PCA), to reduce dimensions along the depth axis to reconstruct motion trajectory</li>
        <li>Our method accurately estimates the force exerted by human with 98% which is validated by realtime load cell and rotary encoder data captured for validation</li>
        <li>We've deployed this system to physicians with QT-based GUI, real time data streaming pipeline with tmux, and post-hoc processing with MATLAB and MySQL</li>
